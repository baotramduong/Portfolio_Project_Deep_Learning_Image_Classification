# Deep Learning Image Classification: Pneumonia 

Build a model that can classify whether a given patient has pneumonia, given a chest x-ray image.

## The Deliverables

There are 5 deliverables for this project:

1. A well documented Jupyter Notebook containing any code and comments explaining it.

            - Image Classification with Deep Learning
           
2. An organized README.md file that describes the contents of the repository.

             - README.md: describes the content and organization of content.
             - Data & Figures folder: contains all provided data and all figures for visualization.
             - Part I: Jupyter notebook
             - Part II: Jupyter notebook
             - Presentation pdf

3. A short PowerPoint presentation (delivered as a PDF export) giving a high-level overview of the methodology used and recommendations for non-technical stakeholders. Can be found in the repository or at: 

4. A Blog Post which can be found at: 

5. A Video Walkthrough of my non-technical presentation, can be found at:

### Data Source

             - https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia
             - The dataset is organized into 3 folders (train, test, val) and contains subfolders for each image category (Pneumonia/Normal). 
             - There are 5,863 X-Ray images (JPEG) and 2 categories (Pneumonia/Normal).

Chest X-ray images (anterior-posterior) were selected from retrospective cohorts of pediatric patients of one to five years old from Guangzhou Women and Children’s Medical Center, Guangzhou. All chest X-ray imaging was performed as part of patients’ routine clinical care.
