2. An organized README.md file that describes the contents of the repository.

             - README.md: describes the content and organization of content.
             - Data & Figures folder: contains all provided data and all figures for visualization.
             - Part I: Jupyter notebook
             - Part II: Jupyter notebook
             - Presentation pdf

3. A short PowerPoint presentation (delivered as a PDF export) giving a high-level overview of the methodology used and recommendations for non-technical stakeholders. Can be found in the repository or at: 

4. A Blog Post which can be found at:
